How can I write about this crazy man with white long beard.I listen to Rabindrasangeet sometimes, honestly not much. I read many of his writings, but honestly not all. I can’t claim myself a Rabindranath expert, but the little I got to know about this person in my life, the philosophy of life I got to read in his writings or listen in his songs, literally gave me the courage to follow my heart and live my best life. Forgive me for saying this, but right here in West Bengal, where he was born,most people are very passionate & proud about discussing his work, but very few actually follow his philosophies to improve their lives.

I got introduced to Rabindranath Tagore very early in my childhood like most Bengali kids. And you know the fun part? I used to think that he was another God. Why? Because in Bengali he is lovingly called “Rabi Thakur”. ‘Thakur’ means God. But trust me, the day I realized that he was not a God, but a common human being like all of us, admiration and respect for him got multiplied many fold.

Also I am very grateful to my school “Mahesh Sri Ramakrishna Ashram Vidyalaya” for involving us in celebrating Rabindranath’s birthday each year.

I remember discussing with one of my friends once, “Did Rabi thakur miss writing about any topic?”. And that’s really true. Through his writings, he covered every aspects of life – love, friendship, courage, challenges, difficulties, education everything. 

Among all other topics, I will emphasize most on Rabithakur’s view on Education. Because that’s what our society needs most at this moment. Education is turned into a meaningless competition today, where young minds are forced into participating everyday. Getting good marks and degrees is being given most importance, than acquiring real knowledge and implementing it to create something meaningful.

Those who are winning this rat race, are settling for a life of rat, forgetting about their potential of being a lion. Those who are losing in this rat race, are brainwashed to believe that they are failures, unworthy of living a great life. The education, which is meant to create better human beings and as a whole a better society, is actually murdering potential in its root.

That’s why it’s very important to remind ourselves what ‘education’ really means, from the words of one of the most ‘educated’ (in the true sense of the term) person this world has ever seen – Rabindranath Tagore.

Most people believe that Rabindranath Tagore or Sachin Tendulkar or successful people from different field were/are gifted with special talents. That’s why they could achieve such greatness. Total bullshit.

Just think how many hours Rabindranath Tagore devoted in writing, how many hours Sachin devoted practicing cricket.

Now tell me honestly, how much time do you devote doing the thing you are good at or you enjoy doing?

Just imagine, what if we could inspire & allow every children to devote to the subject/ idea/ activity they enjoyed most from the very childhood, instead of wasting their valuable time forcing them to memorizing useless data? That’s the world Rabithakur dreamed of, and that’s what I envision too.

I can keep writing on and on. But I have my semester exam day after tomorrow.I will finish it with my most favorite lines written by him:

 
 "Chitto jetha voi shunno , Uccho jetha shir\
gyan jetha mukto , jetha griher prachir\
apon prangon tole dibos shorbori\
bosudhare rakhe nai khondo khudro kori\
jetha bakko ridoyer utsomukh hote\
ucchosia uthe, jetha nirbarito srote\
deshe deshe dishe dishe kormodhara dhai\
ojosro sohosro bidho choritarthotai,\
jetha tuccho acharer morubalu rashi\
bicharer sroto poth fele nai grasi\
pourushere kore ni shotodha , nitto jetha\
tumi sorbo kormo chinta anonder neta,\
nij hoste nirdoi aghat kori pita\
Bharotere sei sorge koro jagorito"

Tagore’s own translation (English Gitanjali Verse 35):

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;\
Where knowledge is free;\
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;\
Where words come out from the depth of truth;\
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;\
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action\
Into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake!!

Here is a fusion A. R. Rahman created with this verse:
