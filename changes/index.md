Hello, I am a third-year undergraduate student at <span style="color:black"> **[IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) (IITK)**</span>, India, <span style="color:black">**majoring in Electrical Engineering**</span> with a <span style="color:black">**minor in Physics**</span>. My current <span style="color:black">**research interests**</span> are in <span style="color:black">**Quantum Computing, Quantum and Classical Information Theory, Quantum Optics and Photonics**,</span> and I aim to make my way into academia. My <span style="color:black">**other academic interests**</span> include <span style="color:black">**Signal and System Theory and Linguistics**</span>. 

This is a **<span style="color:black">[summary of my academic career](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sagnikb/cv.pdf)</span>**. <!---<span style="color:black">**[Here]({{site.baseurl}}/projects)**</span> are some things that I have worked on.-->

When I am not studying/exploring, I can be found listening to music, making up terrible puns, dabbling in History, and doodling. And also reading, which I tend to do a lot of (mostly science fiction, and fantasy). If you want to talk about any of these things, you are welcome to <span style="color:black">**[get in touch with me]({{site.baseurl}}/contact)**</span>.

<!---Some more information about me:-->

<!---* I <span style="color:black">**grew up in the city Kolkata**</span>, West Bengal, India, the City of Joy, from where I get my love for good food, good music and (moderately) long spells of procrastination.-->

* I <span style="color:black">**blog sporadically**</span> at the un-catchily named **<span style="color:black">[Non-Quantum Uncertainty Blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog)</span>**. Bouquets/brickbats welcome!

* I am  <span style="color:black">**one of the leaders of [Science Coffee House](http://students.iitk.ac.in/sch/) in college**</span>, where I enjoy giving and attending fellow students' talks on random scientific topics. Check out some of the talks [here](http://students.iitk.ac.in/sch/talks.html).

* I love listening to <span style="color:black">**music**</span>, especially <span style="color:black">Indian Classical Music and Sufi</span>. I also play the Tabla (an Indian musical instrument).
